## [Golden Delicious Apple Price Prediction - Regression Analysis](https://github.com/Nono-byte/Regression_AM1_DSFT)
In a Fresh Produce Industry, How much stock do you have on hand? Not too little that you run out of stock when customers want to buy more. And not too much that food waste occurs. How do you set your prices? Yields from farms fluctuate by season. Should your prices then also fluctuate by season?

The aim of this project is to construct a regression algorithm, capable of accurately predicting how much a kilogram of Golden Delicious Apples will cost, given certain parameters.

The variable to be predicted(y) is Average Price per Kg

## [Twitter Sentiment Analysis_ Natural language processing](https://github.com/Nono-byte/Classification_AE1_Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis)

### Introduction
In light of the increased volumes of data over the past decade (a.k.a Big Data), there's a high demand by companies for the analysis of data for decision making purposes. Social Media data is a huge source of this data in the form of chats, messages, news feeds, etc. Text analytics is a process that helps analyse this unstructured data and look for useful trends.

Many companies are built around lessening oneâ€™s environmental impact or carbon footprint. They offer products and services that are environmentally friendly and sustainable, in line with their values and ideals. They would like to determine how people perceive climate change and whether or not they believe it is a real threat. This would add to their market research efforts in gauging how their product/service may be received.

Twitter data is a powerful source of information on a wide list of topics. This data can be analyzed to find trends related to specific topics, measure popular sentiment, obtain feedback on past decisions and also help make future decisions.The challenge is to create a Machine Learning model that is able to classify whether or not a person believes in climate change, based on their tweet data.

### Problem statement
Providing an accurate and robust solution using machine learning to create effective tools that give companies access to a broad base of consumer sentiment, spanning multiple demographic and geographic categories - thus increasing their insights and informing future marketing strategies.

## [Movie Recommendation System_ Unsupervised Learning](https://github.com/Nono-byte/Unsupervised_Movie_Recommender_System_Team_TS1-1)

### Problem Statement:
EDSA requires to construction of a recommendation algorithm based on content or collaborative filtering, capable of accurately predicting how a user will rate a movie they have not yet viewed based on their historical preferences.

### Business Goal:
Show the value of recommender system in the industry. These recommender systems assist companies to market their products and services to the target marget, by improving customer service and satisfication. It allows them to increase their market engagement with relevant (items the user likes) products and services which can lead to increase in profits and market share. Industry leading companies such as Netflix and Amazon make use of these recommender systems.
