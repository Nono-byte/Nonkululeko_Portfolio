This project employs Python to conduct a thorough examination of Apple's financial data. The process encompasses retrieving and cleansing data, exploring intricate relationships between various financial metrics, computing essential indicators to gauge financial health, and utilizing a linear regression model to predict Apple's future revenue over the next three years. The findings are then effectively communicated through visually compelling representations, offering valuable insights into Apple's financial performance and potential growth trajectories.

This project delved into portfolio optimization using Python, focusing on constructing and comparing two portfolios: an equal-weighted and an optimized version. The stocks considered were SPY (S&P 500), AMD, MSFT (Microsoft), and GOOGL (Google).

The equal-weighted portfolio, distributed evenly with a $10,000 allocation across the four stocks, underwent a comprehensive analysis, including cumulative return, mean daily return, standard deviation of daily return, Sharpe ratio, and annualized Sharpe ratio.

For portfolio optimization, 10,000 scenarios were generated with random weightings for each stock. Return, volatility, and Sharpe ratio were calculated for each scenario, identifying the optimal portfolio with the highest Sharpe ratio.

### Introduction
In light of the increased volumes of data over the past decade (a.k.a Big Data), there's a high demand by companies for the analysis of data for decision making purposes. Social Media data is a huge source of this data in the form of chats, messages, news feeds, etc. Text analytics is a process that helps analyse this unstructured data and look for useful trends.

Many companies are built around lessening oneâ€™s environmental impact or carbon footprint. They offer products and services that are environmentally friendly and sustainable, in line with their values and ideals. They would like to determine how people perceive climate change and whether or not they believe it is a real threat. This would add to their market research efforts in gauging how their product/service may be received.

Twitter data is a powerful source of information on a wide list of topics. This data can be analyzed to find trends related to specific topics, measure popular sentiment, obtain feedback on past decisions and also help make future decisions.The challenge is to create a Machine Learning model that is able to classify whether or not a person believes in climate change, based on their tweet data.

### Problem statement
Providing an accurate and robust solution using machine learning to create effective tools that give companies access to a broad base of consumer sentiment, spanning multiple demographic and geographic categories - thus increasing their insights and informing future marketing strategies.


## [Golden Delicious Apple Price Prediction - Regression Analysis](https://github.com/Nono-byte/Apple_Price_Prediction_Regression)

In a Fresh Produce Industry, How much stock do you have on hand? Not too little that you run out of stock when customers want to buy more. And not too much that food waste occurs. How do you set your prices? Yields from farms fluctuate by season. Should your prices then also fluctuate by season?

The aim of this project is to construct a regression algorithm, capable of accurately predicting how much a kilogram of Golden Delicious Apples will cost, given certain parameters.

The variable to be predicted(y) is Average Price per Kg


## [Movie Recommendation System_ Unsupervised Learning](https://github.com/Nono-byte/Moive_Recommender_System_Unsupervised_Learning)

### Problem Statement:
EDSA requires to construction of a recommendation algorithm based on content or collaborative filtering, capable of accurately predicting how a user will rate a movie they have not yet viewed based on their historical preferences.

### Business Goal:
Show the value of recommender system in the industry. These recommender systems assist companies to market their products and services to the target marget, by improving customer service and satisfication. It allows them to increase their market engagement with relevant (items the user likes) products and services which can lead to increase in profits and market share. Industry leading companies such as Netflix and Amazon make use of these recommender systems.

### Problem Statement
The Bhejane trading store is an online retailer specialising in Covid essesstial items. The store has recently be struggling with the management of its database-related inventory system.

### Business Goal
The denormalised database consists of two tables. The goal is to transform the database such that is in third normal form (3NF) and analyse the data for decision making purposes

## [Watch History data anlysis and verification](https://github.com/Nono-byte/Watch-History-Verification)

### Problem statement
The client has expressed a requirement to ensure that the learning device restricts students from performing multiple tasks simultaneously. The client wants to verify whether the system enforces this restriction effectively to maintain a seamless learning experience for the students.

The problem at hand is to assess the learning platform's functionality and confirm that it prevents students from engaging in more than one task concurrently. This restriction is crucial to ensure that students can focus on a single task at a time, preventing distractions and promoting efficient learning.

The client expects the following outcomes from the verification process:

- Identify any instances where students are able to perform multiple tasks simultaneously on the learning platform.
- Evaluate the system's behavior when students attempt to switch between tasks and confirm that it enforces the restriction effectively.
- Assess the responsiveness and reliability of the system in enforcing the task restriction across various user scenarios.
- Provide actionable recommendations to address any identified gaps or issues in the system's ability to restrict students to one task at a time.
- Ensure that the learning platform delivers a seamless and distraction-free learning experience for students, allowing them to focus on their educational tasks effectively.
